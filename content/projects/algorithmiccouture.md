description: Algorithmic Couture is an online platform service to provide zero waste
  bespoke garments made with AI for a more sustainable future for the environment.
  The use of curve pattern cutting on square fabrics have been conventionally centered
  around the creativity of fashion designers and will to adhere to the dimensional
  body types of the customers. But as a result, 15% waste in fabric is created. By
  building upon zero waste pattern techniques that have history in Japanese straight
  cut patterns, we aim to reduce waste created. Furthermore we aim to automate the
  process of bespoken garments through the use of digital fabrication technologies
  to create garments on order, rather than creating mass amount of stock. Because
  of this, the amount of energy, waste, and cost through stock can be reduced.
